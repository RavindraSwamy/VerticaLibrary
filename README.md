# VerticaLibrary

This project is developed to facilitate Vertica UDX Development. 

If you are migrating from source database (oracle, Sybase etc ..) to Vertica and if you have got stored procedures then you might be in trouble some situation.

But not to worry, this project includes classes and functions needed to communicate with Vertica Database.
